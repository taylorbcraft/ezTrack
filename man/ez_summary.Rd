\title{Summarize Animal Tracking Data}
\usage{
ez_summary(data, startDate = NULL, endDate = NULL, report = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or sf object with columns `id`, `timestamp`, `x`, and `y`.}

\item{startDate}{Optional. A `Date` object or string (e.g., "2021-01-01"). Filters out data before this date.}

\item{endDate}{Optional. A `Date` object or string (e.g., "2021-01-15"). Filters out data after this date.}

\item{report}{Logical. If TRUE, opens an HTML summary table in your browser for easy copying into slides or documents.}
}
\value{
A data frame with summary statistics per `id`, or an HTML table if `report = TRUE`.
}
\description{
Calculate basic summary statistics per tracked individual. This function is useful
for quickly understanding data coverage, gaps, and movement distance for each animal.
The following summary statistics are returned for each unique `id`:
- `n_fixes`: Number of location records
- `first_location`: Timestamp of the first recorded location
- `last_location`: Timestamp of the last recorded location
- `tracking_duration_days`: Duration between first and last fix (in days)
- `fixes_per_day`: Average number of fixes per day
- `median_interval_hours`: Median interval between fixes (in hours)
- `max_time_gap_days`: Longest time gap between consecutive fixes (in days)
- `distance_km`: Total distance traveled (in kilometers), calculated using the Haversine formula
- `avg_speed_kmh`: Average speed (km/h), computed as distance divided by tracking duration in hours
